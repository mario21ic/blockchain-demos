Contract version

Version Pragma
All solidity source code should start with a "version pragma" — a declaration of the version of the Solidity compiler this code should use. This is to prevent issues with future compiler versions potentially introducing changes that would break your code.

For the scope of this tutorial, we'll want to be able to compile our smart contracts with any compiler version in the range of 0.5.0 (inclusive) to 0.6.0 (exclusive). It looks like this: pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;.

Putting it together, here is a bare-bones starting contract — the first thing you'll write every time you start a new project:

pragma solidity >=0.5.0 <0.6.0;

contract HelloWorld {
}
*/


contract ZombieFactory {

    uint myUnsignedInteger = 100; // is equal to uint256, others uint8, uint16, uint32.
    uint dnDigits = 16;

    //start here

}
