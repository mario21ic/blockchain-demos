/*
State Variables & Integers

Unsigned Integers: uint
The uint data type is an unsigned integer, meaning its value must be non-negative. There's also an int data type for signed integers.
Note: In Solidity, uint is actually an alias for uint256, a 256-bit unsigned integer. You can declare uints with less bits â€” uint8, uint16, uint32, etc.. But in general you want to simply use uint except in specific cases, which we'll talk about in later lessons.

    uint myUnsignedInteger = 100; // is equal to uint256, others uint8, uint16, uint32.
    uint dnDigits = 16;

    //start here
